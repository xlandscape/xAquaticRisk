Description: Methods for spatial data analysis with vector (points, lines, polygons) and raster (grid) data. Methods for vector data include standard operations such as intersect and buffer. Raster methods include global, local, zonal, and focal computations. The predict and interpolate methods facilitate the use of regression type (interpolation, machine learning) models for spatial prediction, including with satellite remote sensing data. Processing of very large files is supported. See the manual and tutorials on <https://rspatial.org/terra/> to get started. 'terra' is a replacement for the 'raster' package ('terra' can do more, and it is faster and easier to use).
