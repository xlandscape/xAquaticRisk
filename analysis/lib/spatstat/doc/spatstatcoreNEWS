OVERVIEW

    o Bug fixes and minor improvements.

BUG FIXES

    o rhohat.ppp
    The argument 'subset' was not handled correctly in the internal data.
    The estimated function 'rho' was correct, but if 'predict.rhohat' was applied,
    predictions were computed only in the 'subset', and were possibly incorrect values.
    Fixed.

    o Gfox, Jfox
    Warnings were issued about text formatting errors (mentioning 'sprintf' or 'fmt').
    Fixed.

    reducing the likelihood of strange-looking plots when 'sigma' is very small.

BUG FIXES

    Crashed if the observation window had zero area.
    Fixed.

    o dirichletVoronoi.ppp

    The code for generating random spatial patterns (including 'rpoispp',
    'rMatClust', 'rThomas', 'rNeymanScott', 'rStrauss', 'rmh')
    has been removed from 'spatstat.core' and placed in a new package
    'spatstat.random'. This new package is required by 'spatstat.core'.

    Improved labelling of models in output.

    o qqplot.ppm, plot.qqppm
    Improved the text label indicating the type of residuals.

    o reload.or.compute

    For Gibbs (non-Poisson) models, the variance matrix was
    calculated incorrectly in some cases. 
    Fixed.

    o anova.mppm
    Results were sometimes incorrect if the two models
    had different interactions (e.g. Strauss vs Poisson).
    Fixed.

    o anova.mppm
    Crashed for some models with a message about 'coefficient missing
    from new.coef'.
    Fixed.

    New arguments 'xlim', 'ylim' determine the range of parameter values
    to be considered.

    o Hybrid
    Printed output from hybrid models has been improved slightly.

    o kppm

    the optimization algorithm should be numerically stabilized.

    o pcf
    Improved error message
    
BUG FIXES

    o kppm
    Results were sometimes incorrect for method='clik2' and method='palm'
    because the log composite likelihood was erroneously truncated to
    positive values. Any fitted model for which logLik(model) = 2.2e-16
    should be suspected of being incorrect.
    Fixed.

    o edge.Ripley
    Results were incorrect for data points lying exactly at the corners
    of a rectangle.
    Fixed.

    o MultiHard
    A hybrid of 'MultiHard' with another multitype interaction caused an error.

    Fixed.

    The default plot labels in 'as.fv(x)' implied that the model 'x' was inhomogeneous.
    Fixed.

    as well as the spatial coordinates: function(x,y,marks).
    
    o mppm
    Covariates which are functions may now depend on the marks
    as well as the spatial coordinates: function(x,y,marks).

    onto a finer grid.

    Columns identified by the arguments 'same' and 'different'
    may now be absent from some of the 'fv' objects that will be collapsed.

    has changed slightly, to adhere more closely to the description in
    the help file.

    Now prints a message indicating whether the data were recomputed
    or reloaded from file.
    New argument 'verbose'.

    New argument 'envir'.
    
    o clusterfit
    Minor changes to the argument list.

    o mincontrast

    o mincontrast
    Improved algorithm for handling NA, NaN or infinite values.

    o varcount
    Argument B has a sensible default.

    o pool.envelope
    Now uses the value of 'nrank' which was used in the original envelopes.

    No longer issues a warning about changed behaviour in the case where
    'lambda' is a fitted model.
    
BUG FIXES

    o subfits
    The fitted interaction coefficients were garbled.
    If 'mfit' is the mppm object and 'a <- subfits(mfit)[[i]]' is one of the
    sub-models, then coef(a) was correct, but coef(fitin(a)) was incorrect.
    The fitted interaction was shown correctly by printing 'mfit'
    but incorrectly by printing 'a'.
    Fixed.
    
    o varcount
    The result was very inaccurate if the cluster radius was small 
    compared to the size of the window 'B', due to discretisation error.
    Fixed.

    o segregation.test
    The test statistic was calculated as the mean, rather than the sum,
    of discrepancies between probabilities. (The p-value was not affected.)
    Fixed.

    o Kest
    If 'domain' was specified, 'rmax' was ignored.
    Fixed.

    o edge.Ripley
    Value was incorrect for a point lying exactly on a corner.
    Fixed.

    around a constant function.
    Fixed.

    because an 'edge correction' was mistakenly applied.
    Fixed.

    o rhohat
    The rug plot (produced by plot.rhohat) was incorrect
    when rhohat was called with method="piecewise".
    Fixed.

    o markcrosscorr

    Fixed.

   o roc.ppp

    specified, then the results were incorrect whenever the Frame of the
    simulation window was not a square.)

        CHANGES IN spatstat.core VERSION 1.65-0

OVERVIEW

    o Package initialised at version 1.65-0

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.core
    The package 'spatstat.core' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains the core functionality for statistical analysis of
    spatial data. For an overview, see help("spatstat.core-package")

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.core' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
