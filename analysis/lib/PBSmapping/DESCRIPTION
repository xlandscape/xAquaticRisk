Description: This software has evolved from fisheries research conducted at the
   Pacific Biological Station (PBS) in 'Nanaimo', British Columbia, Canada. It
   extends the R language to include two-dimensional plotting features similar
   to those commonly available in a Geographic Information System (GIS).
   Embedded C code speeds algorithms from computational geometry, such as
   finding polygons that contain specified point events or converting between
   longitude-latitude and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates.
   Additionally, we include 'C++' code developed by Angus Johnson for the
   'Clipper' library, data for a global shoreline, and other data sets in the
   public domain. Under the user's R library directory '.libPaths()',
   specifically in './PBSmapping/doc', a complete user's guide is offered and
   should be consulted to use package functions effectively.
