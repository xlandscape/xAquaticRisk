			******** VERSION 0.13.3 ********

BUG FIXES

  - The S3 plot() method for class Intervals was ignoring the y argument. (The
    method for class Intervals_full did, however, use the argument properly.)
    This has been fixed.

			******** VERSION 0.13.2 ********

BUG FIXES

  - The initialization method for the Intervals class threw errors when empty
    objects were created. This has been fixed.

			******** VERSION 0.13.0 ********
NEW FEATURES

  - New interval_included methods, similar to interval_overlap, but requiring
    full inclusion.

			******** VERSION 0.12.3 ********
NEW FEATURES

  - S3 as.matrix methods for Intervals and Intervals_full objects.

			******** VERSION 0.12.0 ********
NEW FEATURES

  - S3 plot methods for Intervals and Intervals_full objects.

			******** VERSION 0.11.1 ********

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

  - The interval_overlap and distance_to_nearest methods are now just wrappers
    for which_nearest. Because of this, the argument names for interval_overlap,
    have been changed from 'target' and 'query' to 'from' and 'to',
    respectively, in order to match the other two functions. Argument order is
    the same as before, but functions which call arguments by name and use the
    old names will now generate an (informative) error message.

BUG FIXES

  - The C++ code for interval_overlap correctly handles all varieties of
    endpoint closure, but does not handle cases like (0,2) vs. (1,3) over
    Z. (These intervals do not overlap, even though the right endpoint of the
    first interval is nominally after the left endpoint of the second interval.)
    This should have been handled by the R wrapper -- by applying
    close_intervals before passing on to compiled code -- but this step had
    previously been omitted. This is now fixed.

NEW FEATURES

  - The interval_overlap, which_nearest, and distance_to_nearest methods now all
    accept a numeric vector in both the 'from' and 'to' arguments.

IMPROVEMENTS

  - The distance_to_nearest methods were previously based on old code using
    approxfun(). They now work of the same algorithm used for interval_overlap
    and which_nearest. This algorithm simultaneously generates all three types
    of information: identity of overlaps and nearest neighbors, as well as
    distance to nearest neighbors.

NEW FEATURES

  - Adding a NEWS file!
    
  - Added which_nearest methods, as a complement to distance_to_nearest. The C++
    code previously used for interval_overlap calculations was augmented to
    provide this functionality.
