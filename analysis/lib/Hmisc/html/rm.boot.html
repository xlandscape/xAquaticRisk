<h2>
Bootstrap Repeated Measurements Model
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For a dataset containing a time variable, a scalar response variable,
and an optional subject identification variable, obtains least squares
estimates of the coefficients of a restricted cubic spline function or
a linear regression in time after adjusting for subject effects
through the use of subject dummy variables.  Then the fit is
bootstrapped <code>B</code> times, either by treating time and subject ID as
fixed (i.e., conditioning the analysis on them) or as random
variables.  For the former, the residuals from the original model fit
are used as the basis of the bootstrap distribution.  For the latter,
samples are taken jointly from the time, subject ID, and response
vectors to obtain unconditional distributions.
</p>
<p>If a subject <code>id</code> variable is given, the bootstrap sampling will
be based on samples with replacement from subjects rather than from
individual data points.  In other words, either none or all of a given
subject's data will appear in a bootstrap sample.  This cluster
sampling takes into account any correlation structure that might exist
within subjects, so that confidence limits are corrected for
within-subject correlation.  Assuming that ordinary least squares
estimates, which ignore the correlation structure, are consistent
(which is almost always true) and efficient (which would not be true
for certain correlation structures or for datasets in which the number
of observation times vary greatly from subject to subject), the
resulting analysis will be a robust, efficient repeated measures
analysis for the one-sample problem.
</p>
<p>Predicted values of the fitted models are evaluated by default at a
grid of 100 equally spaced time points ranging from the minimum to
maximum observed time points.  Predictions are for the average subject
effect.  Pointwise confidence intervals are optionally computed
separately for each of the points on the time grid.  However,
simultaneous confidence regions that control the level of confidence
for the entire regression curve lying within a band are often more
appropriate, as they allow the analyst to draw conclusions about
nuances in the mean time response profile that were not stated
apriori.  The method of <cite>Tibshirani (1997)</cite> is used to easily
obtain simultaneous confidence sets for the set of coefficients of the
spline or linear regression function as well as the average  intercept
parameter (over subjects).  Here one computes the objective criterion
(here both the -2 log likelihood evaluated at the bootstrap estimate
of beta but with respect to the original design matrix and response
vector, and the sum of squared errors in predicting the original
response vector) for the original fit as well as for all of the
bootstrap fits.  The confidence set of the regression coefficients is
the set of all coefficients that are associated with objective
function values that are less than or equal to say the 0.95 quantile
of the vector of <i>\code{B} + 1</i> objective function values.  For
the coefficients satisfying this condition, predicted curves are
computed at the time grid, and minima and maxima of these curves are
computed separately at each time point toderive the final
simultaneous confidence band.
</p>
<p>By default, the log likelihoods that are computed for obtaining the
simultaneous confidence band assume independence within subject.  This
will cause problems unless such log likelihoods have very high rank
correlation with the log likelihood allowing for dependence.  To allow
for correlation or to estimate the correlation function, see the
<code>cor.pattern</code> argument below.

</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>smoother</code></td>
<td>

<p>a smoothing function that is used if <code>plot.individual=TRUE</code>.
Default is <code><a href="../../stats/html/supsmu.html">supsmu</a></code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>xlab</code></td>
<td>

<p>label for x-axis.  Default is <code>"units"</code> attribute of the
original <code>time</code> variable, or <code>"Time"</code> if no such
attribute was defined using the <code>units</code> function.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>xlim</code></td>
<td>

<p>specifies x-axis plotting limits.  Default is to use range of times
specified to <code>rm.boot</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ylim</code></td>
<td>

<p>for <code>rm.boot</code> this is a vector of y-axis limits used if
<code>plot.individual=TRUE</code>.  It is also passed along for later use
by <code>plot.rm.boot</code>.  For <code>plot.rm.boot</code>, <code>ylim</code> can
be specified, to override the value stored in the object stored by
<code>rm.boot</code>.  The default is the actual range of <code>y</code> in the
input data.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>times</code></td>
<td>

<p>a sequence of times at which to evaluated fitted values and
confidence limits.  Default is 100 equally spaced points in the
observed range of <code>time</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>absorb.subject.effects</code></td>
<td>

<p>If <code>TRUE</code>, adjusts the response vector <code>y</code> before
re-sampling so that the subject-specific effects in the initial
model fit are all zero.  Then in re-sampling, subject effects are
not used in the models.  This will downplay one of the sources of
variation.  This option is used mainly for checking for consistency
of results, as the re-sampling analyses are simpler when
<code>absort.subject.effects=TRUE</code>.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>rho</code></td>
<td>

<p>The log-likelihood function that is used as the basis of
simultaneous confidence bands assumes normality with independence
within subject. To check the robustness of this assumption, if
<code>rho</code> is not zero, the log-likelihood under multivariate
normality within subject, with constant correlation <code>rho</code>
between any two time points, is also computed.  If the two
log-likelihoods have the same ranks across re-samples, alllowing
the correlation structure does not matter.  The agreement in ranks
is quantified using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient.  The
<code><a href="../../graphics/html/plot.default.html">plot</a></code> method allows the non-zero intra-subject
correlation log-likelihood to be used in deriving the simultaneous
confidence band.  Note that this approach does assume
homoscedasticity.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cor.pattern</code></td>
<td>

<p>More generally than using an equal-correlation structure, you can
specify a function of two time vectors that generates as many
correlations as the length of these vectors.  For example,
<code>cor.pattern=function(time1,time2) 0.2^(abs(time1-time2)/10)</code>
would specify a dampening serial correlation pattern.
<code>cor.pattern</code> can also be a list containing vectors <code>x</code>
(a vector of absolute time differences) and <code>y</code> (a
corresponding vector of correlations).  To estimate the correlation
function as a function of absolute time differences within
subjects, specify <code>cor.pattern="estimate"</code>.  The products of
all possible pairs of residuals (or at least up to <code>ncor</code> of
them) within subjects will be related to the absolute time
difference.  The correlation function is estimated by computing the
sample mean of the products of standardized residuals, stratified
by absolute time difference.  The correlation for a zero time
difference is set to 1 regardless of the <code><a href="../../stats/html/lowess.html">lowess</a></code>
estimate.  NOTE: This approach fails in the presence of large
subject effects; correcting for such effects removes too much of
the correlation structure in the residuals.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ncor</code></td>
<td>

<p>the maximum number of pairs of time values used in estimating the
correlation function if <code>cor.pattern="estimate"</code>
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>other arguments to pass to <code>smoother</code> if <code>plot.individual=TRUE</code>
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>obj2</code></td>
<td>

<p>a second object created by <code>rm.boot</code> that can also be passed
to <code>plot.rm.boot</code>.  This is used for two-sample problems for
which the time profiles are allowed to differ between the two
groups.  The bootstrapped predicted y values for the second fit are
subtracted from the fitted values for the first fit so that the
predicted mean response for group 1 minus the predicted mean
response for group 2 is what is plotted. The confidence bands that
are plotted are also for this difference.  For the simultaneous
confidence band, the objective criterion is taken to be the sum of
the objective criteria (-2 log L or sum of squared errors) for the
separate fits for the two groups. The <code>times</code> vectors must
have been identical for both calls to <code>rm.boot</code>, although
<code>NA</code>s can be inserted by the user of one or both of the time
vectors in the <code>rm.boot</code> objects so as to suppress certain
sections of the difference curve from being plotted.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>conf.int</code></td>
<td>

<p>the confidence level to use in constructing simultaneous, and
optionally pointwise, bands.  Default is 0.95.

<tr valign="top"><td><code>ylab</code></td>
<td>

<p>label for y-axis.  Default is the <code>"label"</code> attribute of the
original <code>y</code> variable, or <code>"y"</code> if no label was assigned
to <code>y</code> (using the <code>label</code> function, for example).

to the simultaneous band
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>curves.in.simultaneous.band</code></td>
<td>

<p>set to <code>TRUE</code> to draw all bootstrap regression fits that had a
sum of squared errors (obtained by predicting the original <code>y</code>
vector from the original <code>time</code> vector and <code>id</code> vector)
that was less that or equal to the <code>conf.int</code> quantile of all
bootstrapped models (plus the original model). This will show how
the point by point max and min were computed to form the
simultaneous confidence band.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>col.pointwise.band</code></td>

<p>color for the pointwise confidence band.  Default is <span class="samp">2</span>,
which defaults to red for default Windows S-PLUS setups.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>objective</code></td>
<td>

<p>the default is to use the -2 times log of the Gaussian likelihood
for computing the simultaneous confidence region.  If neither
<code>cor.pattern</code> nor <code>rho</code> was specified to <code>rm.boot</code>,
the independent homoscedastic Gaussian likelihood is
used. Otherwise the dependent homoscedastic likelihood is used
according to the specified or estimated correlation
pattern. Specify <code>objective="sse"</code> to instead use the sum of
squared errors.

<tr valign="top"><td><code>add</code></td>
<td>

<p>set to <code>TRUE</code> to add curves to an existing plot.  If you do
this, titles and subtitles are omitted.

</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ncurves</code></td>
<td>

<p>when using <code>individual.boot=TRUE</code> or
<code>curves.in.simultaneous.band=TRUE</code>, you can plot a random
sample of <code>ncurves</code> of the fitted curves instead of plotting
up to <code>B</code> of them.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>multi</code></td>

<p>set to <code>TRUE</code> to draw multiple simultaneous confidence bands
shaded with different colors.  Confidence levels vary over the
values in the <code>multi.conf</code> vector.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>multi.method</code></td>
<td>

<p>specifies the method of shading when <code>multi=TRUE</code>.  Default is
to use colors, with the default colors chosen so that when the
graph is printed under S-Plus for Windows 4.0 to an HP LaserJet
printer, the confidence regions are naturally ordered by darkness
of gray-scale. Regions closer to the point estimates (i.e., the
center) are darker. Specify <code>multi.method="density"</code> to
instead use densities of lines drawn per inch in the confidence
regions, with all regions drawn with the default color. The
<code><a href="../../graphics/html/polygon.html">polygon</a></code> function is used to shade the regions.

<p>vector of densities in lines per inch corresponding to

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Observations having missing <code>time</code> or <code>y</code> are excluded from
the analysis.
</p>
<p>As most repeated measurement studies consider the times as design
points, the fixed covariable case is the default. Bootstrapping the
residuals from the initial fit assumes that the model is correctly
specified.  Even if the covariables are fixed, doing an unconditional
bootstrap is still appropriate, and for large sample sizes
unconditional confidence intervals are only slightly wider than
conditional ones.  For moderate to small sample sizes, the
<code>bootstrap.type="x random"</code> method can be fairly conservative.
</p>
<p>If not all subjects have the same number of observations (after
deleting observations containing missing values) and if
<code>bootstrap.type="x fixed"</code>, bootstrapped residual vectors may
have a length m that is different from the number of original
observations n.  If <i>m &gt; n</i> for a bootstrap
repetition, the first n elements of the randomly drawn residuals
are used. If <i>m &lt; n</i>, the residual vector is appended
with a random sample with replacement of length <i>n - m</i> from itself.  A warning message is issued if this happens.
If the number of time points per subject varies, the bootstrap results
for <code>bootstrap.type="x fixed"</code> can still be invalid, as this
method assumes that a vector (over subjects) of all residuals can be
added to the original yhats, and varying number of points will cause
mis-alignment.
</p>
<p>For <code>bootstrap.type="x random"</code> in the presence of significant
subject effects, the analysis is approximate as the subjects used in
any one bootstrap fit will not be the entire list of subjects.  The
average (over subjects used in the bootstrap sample) intercept is used
from that bootstrap sample as a predictor of average subject effects
in the overall sample.
</p>
<p>Once the bootstrap coefficient matrix is stored by <code>rm.boot</code>,
<code>plot.rm.boot</code> can be run multiple times with different options
(e.g, different confidence levels).
</p>
<p>See <code><a href="../../rms/help/bootcov.html">bootcov</a></code> in the <span class="pkg">rms</span> library for a general
approach to handling repeated measurement data for ordinary linear
models, binary and ordinal models, and survival models, using the
unconditional bootstrap.  <code><a href="../../rms/help/bootcov.html">bootcov</a></code> does not handle bootstrapping
residuals.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an object of class <code>rm.boot</code> is returned by <code>rm.boot</code>. The
principal object stored in the returned object is a matrix of
regression coefficients for the original fit and all of the bootstrap
repetitions (object <code>Coef</code>), along with vectors of the
corresponding -2 log likelihoods are sums of squared errors. The
original fit object from <code>lm.fit.qr</code> is stored in
<code>fit</code>. For this fit, a cell means model is used for the
<code>id</code> effects.
</p>
<p><code>plot.rm.boot</code> returns a list containing the vector of times used
for plotting along with the overall fitted values, lower and upper
simultaneous confidence limits, and optionally the pointwise
confidence limits.
