config                  Internal configuration and test data
snowfall-calculation    Parallel calculation functions
snowfall-init           Initialisation of cluster usage
snowfall-package        Toplevel useability wrapper for snow to make
                        parallel programming even more easy and
                        comfortable.  All functions are able to run
                        without cluster in sequential mode.  Also
                        snowfall works as connector to the cluster
                        management program sfCluster, but can also run
                        without it.
